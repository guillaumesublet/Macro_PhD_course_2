# Macro_PhD_course_2
Course on the optimal design of macroeconomic policy.

The objective of this course is to equip students with knowledge and techniques that will allow them to develop their research in macroeconomics. This course focuses on the design of macroeconomic policy and its quantitative evaluation. The course starts with the Ramsey and Mirrleesian theories for the design of economic policy. It then covers the design of rules with applications to the design of fiscal and monetary rules. The quantitative application of these theories is studied with numerical techniques from [QuantEcon](https://quantecon.org/lectures/).
