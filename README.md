# Macro_PhD_course_2
Course on the optimal design of macroeconomic policy.

The objective of this course is to equip students with knowledge and techniques that will allow them to develop their research in macroeconomics. This course focuses on the design of macroeconomic policy and its quantitative evaluation. The course starts with the Ramsey and Mirrleesian theories of the design of economic policy. It then covers the design of rules with applications to the design of fiscal and monetary rules. The course also presents numerical methods to study the quantitative implications of optimal reforms of macroeconomic policies.

The course is divided in two parts. The first part covers the theory. The second part asks students to put the theory in practice by replicating and presenting cutting edge research that applies these tools. Student evaluations are based on a problem set and a midterm exam for the first part of the course. The second part is evaluated on the basis of the replication of a paper and the presentation of two papers.
